        explanation: "HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and applications. HTML provides the structure and content of a web page, allowing developers to define the different elements and their relationships within a document. Imagine a web page as a house. HTML is like the blueprint that defines the layout and structure of the house. It determines where the walls, doors, windows, and other elements should be placed. Similarly, HTML defines the structure of a web page by using tags to mark up different elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. HTML tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and consist of an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag indicates the start of an element, while the closing tag indicates the end. For example, the <h1> tag is used to define a heading, and it should be closed with the </h1> tag. Here's an example of a simple HTML document structure: ``` <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>My First Web Page</title> </head> <body> <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1> <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p> <img src='image.jpg' alt='An image'> <a href='https://www.example.com'>Click here</a> to visit a website. </body> </html> In this example, the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration specifies the document type as HTML5. The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page. The <head> element contains meta-information about the document, such as the title displayed in the browser's title bar. The <body> element contains the visible content of the web page. To create and edit HTML files, you need a text editor. A text editor is a software tool that allows you to write and edit plain text. There are many text editors available, both free and paid. Some popular text editors for coding HTML include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom. To install a text editor, you can visit the official website of the text editor you want to use and download the installer for your operating system. Once downloaded, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. Homework: 1. What is the purpose of HTML in web development? 2. Can you name three popular text editors for coding HTML?	"
